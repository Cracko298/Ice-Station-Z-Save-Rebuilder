# FAQ:
- ***Why would I need this?***
*Under normal circiumstances you will not need this. However, if you plan to modify, or tinker with save-data. It could corrupt the child-key, as it is more prone to corruption than the parent key.*

- ***What is the Usecase?***

*If you Child-Key gets corrupted, it could lead to overwriting your previous save-data slots.*

- ***Why do I need "9a2ba2abf4b728dd.sav"?***

*It is needed for a number of things, but inside the Child-Key which is what we're trying to aquire.*

- ***Can't you Just Provide the "Child-Key?***

*I cannot because everyone's Save-Keys are unique, but have a fixed byte-size.*
